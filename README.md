# Getting Started with npm packages NSS E-15
This project was created as a part of an introduction to npm packages for NSS E-15.  This was used in a demo of react-bootstrap and luxon.

npm's documentation can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) and packages can be searched [here](https://www.npmjs.com/).  

To use this application as a playground, clone the repository, cd into the root directory and type `npm install`.  This will install all the packages listed under "dependencies" in the package.json file, including React-bootstrap and luxon.  This will create a node_modules directory with all the packages installed for you.  After installing the node packages, type `npm start`, like other react apps, to start serving the application locally.
